# Notes on Syncfusion

These notes are primarily for explaining the various examples I created or downloaded to explore what this library has to offer us. 

Syncfusion WPF is very useful primarily for it's [Docking Manager](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/dockingmanager/overview) feature.
Docking allows for the windows resizing and movement the sponsor wanted. It seems to be exactly what he was looking for. 
It also has a graph view feature which is called an [SfChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/sfchart/overview) that would 
be useful for making graphs. It is highly customizable. 

To run the example you need to install Visual Studio and install Syncfusion WPF. 
To download the free trail of WPF you need to make an account to claim a community license. 
Follow the instructions to install and make sure to check WPF for what is being installed and uncheck the default stuff.

To see a docking example that syncfusion put out, run SyncfusionWpfSample using Visual Studio. All the windows there are movable and resizable. 

To see an example using graphs in the docking windows run SyncfusionWpfSample3. Regina made this one.
